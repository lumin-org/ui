LuminUI is a simple and declarative UI framework, inspired by Vide & Fusion.

## Why use UI?

- Minimal and light
- Declarative
- Beginner-friendly
- Learn once, use everywhere
- Easy to maintain

UI is what you see and interact with. It's the most important part of a program, so we created LuminUI to make it easier to create, manage UI, and put your users first.

If you are looking for something else, **Vide** is a great choice if you're a more advanced user. It shares a similar syntax and structure to LuminUI, but has more layers of complexity that make it great for programmers that are looking for more control.
